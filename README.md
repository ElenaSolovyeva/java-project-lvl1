## About this project

This project offers five mathematical games. 

At the beginning, the program presents a list of games from which the user can choose a preferred option, give the corresponding number in the console and press an 'Enter'-button.

If the player answers each question correctly, he or she wins.
By the first incorrect answer, the player loses, and the program will offer to start the game again.
 
Below are the descriptions and demos of the games.

### 1. "Even"

In this game, the player needs to determine whether a randomly generated number is even and enter the answer ('yes' or 'no') in the console and press an 'Enter'-button.

### 2. Game "Calculator"

In this game, the player must calculate two random numbers with a random operator ('+', '-', '*') and enter the answer in the console and press an 'Enter'-button.

### 3. Game "Greatest Common Devisor"

The task of this game is to find the greatest common divisor of two randomly generated numbers and enter the answer in the console and press an 'Enter'-button.

### 4. Game "Progression"

In this game, the program generates an arithmetic progression of 5 - 10 numbers, in which one of the progression members is hidden behind the '*' sign. The player's task is to calculate this hidden number and enter the answer in the console and press an 'Enter'-button.

### 5. Game "Prime"
 
In this game, the player needs to determine whether a randomly generated number is a prime number and enter the answer ('yes' or 'no') in the console and press an 'Enter'-button. 
A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
